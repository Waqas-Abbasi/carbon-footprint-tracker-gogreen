scrum board is gonna be used ? There is a board on git but isn’t it for ?
Are the libraries inside of JavaDoc considered librairies and are we gonna
have points for that ?

Notes:

In today’s meeting, Silviu is the chair and Nafie is the secretary.

In the meeting, each one of us presented what he found in his research on
different things.

Axian started presenting GUI Research libraries, he presented different
things such as Swing, javaFX and GUIputer. But he did recommend swing.

Waqqas presented the Back-end / Research libraries, he found different
tools to that JDB he thinks that Heroku will be good to host. And our TA,
Thomas suggested Spring.

Silvu has searched for two API, the first one MAEE APi it works with HTTPS
request/response, it calculated the carbon footprint in several countries.
This api has a decent documentation. The second one calculates the carbon
footprint of food, transportation, but it has some bug. Thomas recommended
using the first one.He also say that to put in the back of our planning and
that the calculations of CO2 can be mocked.

NAfie’s discussed some informations on Databases and how to connect it to
the demo.server. There is JDBC which is a java driver the allows the programmer
to send and get requests and queries to the SQL database.

Moreover, Thomas asked us to edit the read me and he will put our master
private.

We decided that we are going to do all of our code on a development branch
and then when everything is working, we will merge to Master so that our
master will be always a working version of our App.

We have to do some research on this Pull based development.

For next week, we need to have a demo.server and client side with simple
request/answer with the Database set up on Heroku.
