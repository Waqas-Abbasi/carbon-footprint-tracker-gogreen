During this last meeting, we will show the TA the final version of our app working with sessions with a test coverage of 100%. 
The app is actually working, but both the webApp and the Android APP are still on working progress. 

Waqas will show some parts of his webApp and see what the TA can suggest.

Other than this, the TA will give us some feedback on our final report, then we can make it better and fix it before the deadline.
