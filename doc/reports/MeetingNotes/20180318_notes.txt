Demo: 
The demo was succesful and runned very smoothely, we had all our tests and our branches were all covered.
Then we discussed some issues that we presented in our agenda for today and the TA said that:
what needs to be improved on:
- a small issue with the vegetarian meal
- we have to make a release today (18-3-2019)
- checkstyle supress warnings
- more test coverage.
