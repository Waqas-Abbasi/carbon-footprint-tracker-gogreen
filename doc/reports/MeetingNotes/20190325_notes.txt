In week 7th’s meeting we started out with a brief explanation of what each of the team members has accomplished during the previous week and what are our expectations and concerns about the coming demo and report draft.

Chairman was Anxian and Kalin was secretary.

Our TA encouraged us to merge everything in master and get rid of big part of our branches, because we have around 20.

Some guides around the report. The report should consist of:
1.	How the project went?
2.	Why did we used… techniques; problems with tools and frameworks?
3.	How I am going to do my next project, what am I going to do like I did and what I will change?
4.	Individual reflection on the plan.
5.	Value sensitive design


Our TA gave us some ideas about improving our GUI.

We also need to write better documentation and also stick to the same style of comment writing.
