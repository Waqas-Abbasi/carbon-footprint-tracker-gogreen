### Personal Development Plan
##### Goals

1) Getting more practical experience with Java or OOP languages in general, as I had no experience before I started the CSE program I stil have a lot to learn.

2) As was explained in the startup lecture that programming is generally done in big teams. So far we have only done programming on our own and I am curious as to how programming in a team works. This is my most important goal so I am glad that this is also the main goal of the project.

3) Learning how to plan a big project without propper instructions. I wanted to start this course because I imagined the amount of creativity programming allows you to express is great, so not only do I want to know how to tackle problems, but also how to translate an idea into an actual working program.

##### What can I do so far

1) I feel like I have learned a lot of practical abilities during this course so far, but I am far from where I eventually want to get. I want to become more efficient at programming then I am currently.

2) as mentioned earlier my ability to actually craete something from the ground up is practically zero unless I get clear instructions. Being able to do so is what motivated me to start this course, so I hope I will learn how to do this.

3) working in a group is something I can do well as long as I have somewhat cooperative team mates. 

##### Plan to get to where I want to be from where I am now

Because everything is very new to me my current intentions of achieving my goals is mainly relying on the TU CSE program untill I feel like I have enough knowledge to create my own way to learn. Doing this project does feel like a big challange because it requires me to do something I do not know how to do, but I also know that I personally learn way more efficient from practical studying so the project seems like a perfect way to learn some of the abilities I want to have.

So since I want to learn how to program as a team mostly I will do so by being a cooperative team mate and ask both tham and the TA for help, since that's part of the advatages of working as a team. All I need from my team mates is to be cooperative as well.

### Personal Development Plan
##### Strong points
* Plan out activities: Usually when I do a project I like to make a detailed planning of what to do and when to do it.
* Invest time in learning new things: Whenever I stumble upon a thing I don't quite understand or needs some more investigation, I go to the internet and search for it until I totally get it.

##### Weaker points
* Keeping oversight of a large project: Whenever I do a some what larger project I quickly lose oversight of the general picture of the project.
* Using API's: I have some experience using API's, but it wasn't necessarily good experience so to say.

##### My Goals
My goals this project is to improve my two weaker points, that I have described above. Thus getting better at keeping oversight of a large project and learning better how to use API's. Also I would like to learn how to use IntelliJ. I have never used this before but for this project we are going to use this IDE.

##### Achieving my goal
I think achieve my goals for this project will come as I progress further in the project, since I have to use all the three skills I described above to do this project. Of course if I want to get even better at some of those skills, I can practice them outside of this project at home. I can make a small project of my own to get more familiar with IntelliJ or try out some API's on my own.

### Personal Development Plan

One of the goals I aim on working towards is working in a realistic environment for Software Engineering Project. I aim to achieve this by making sure I strictly follow all the guidlines imposed on this project and aiming for a grade 10, and I believe achieving a grade 10 will be a good measure that I achieved all the expectations from a software engineer perspective. This goal is important to me because I plan on working on software engineering projects in the future.

Another goal I'm looking forward to work towards is learning version control. I've always known the importance of version control but always found it hard to full understand how it works and through this project I aim to fully incorporate and make use of version control to manage and work together on the coding with the team.

I'm also looking forward to creating a desktop application as I've had the chance to do so. This project will also help me be familiar with the tools requried for development in software projects such as source tree, IntelliJ. 

Alongside this, I'm also interested in working on the backend of your application (Serverside) and looking to learn how the demo.server works with the GUI and the database to make a seemless application. This will be particularily more interesting for me because I've always enjoyed working on backend for web apps, and it will be interesting to work from a different perspective
(Java). My plan to achieve this goal is to by making sure to read and research about demo.server technology and best guidelines to implement a high quality service to the end user. I will also be practicing a lot at home making sure I fully understand how the java implements demo.server technology to create scalable and consistent software. 

Another aspect of the project that I'm really curious about is producing software for a customer, who ideally in the real world does not know what he wants and It will be interesting to see how this plays out with the solution we provide to our customer for the carbon footprint application.

All and all I'm really looking forward to working on this project because it will overall improve my ability to work as a team and my ability to develop industry level software. It will also be interesting to see how much knowledge I will gain from this at the end of the project.

### Personal Development Plan
##### G - Goal

My current goal is to learn to visualize application and divide bigger problems int o achievable subproblems.
I want to learn how to work in a team which employs AGILE and SCRUM so I be more productive and contribute better to the development of the appliccation.

##### R - Reality

At this point I have no experience with GitLab and with anything that is linked to creating large scale applications.
I also want to improve on the quality of the code I write and and make it more suitable for working in a team.

##### O - Options

I have 9 weeks to deliver the app and learn alot in the process. I have a motivated team to help me 
 
##### W - Will

I am going to do alot of reading in order to get a better understanding of what I am doing and will try to contribute on a weekly/daily basis to the project

### Personal Development Plan

I think my strong points are creative and self-discipline. Sometimes maybe I will have some specific ideas in the team and I will force myself to finish the work before deadline. And my weaker points are bad at communicating. I do not want to talk a lot in the team since my poor English and reserved. Sometimes I will be nervous when I can not do my part of the work. Sometimes creative might go far to unpractical. Maybe I need to think less but it might become thoughtless. Self-discipline might go far to anxious. Maybe I need to relax at some time but it might become too soft on myself.

During this course, I have these goal to achieve:
1.Can think deeply how to solve the problem before actually solving.
2.Develop my coding skill
3.Improve my English
4.Know how to communicate with each other.

Because I want to have a critical thinking in my life, not only when I program. But programming can help me to practice. I want to create something cool to make our life more convenient but it based on a strong coding skill and basic knowledge. So I want to develop my coding skill. And I am not good at English, to be honest, I am bad at it. It influences my life a lot as well as my study. I want to improve my English when I doing this course since we need to communicate with each other about the project. I am also bad at working in a team since I do not have such experience before. I hope these goals below can be achieved after this course but some of these might be achieved in a couple year. Now I am working on my goals but it doesn¡¯t seems going well. Sometimes I am worried about communicate with others because of my poor English. I also need to study a lot of new staff to know how to do this project. Maybe I need make a detailed plan which states what I need to learn in that specific day.I want to think more before coding and watch the video about Java and read more java document. Practice is also important. Coding more and learn how to code better from my teammates . I also want to try to learn some English words everyday and talk in the team. I want to doing these things from now on. Firstly, I need to watch the video about java to improve my coding skill .My teammates can teach me something in java I am not good at. And we will communicate with each other.

### Personal Development Plan

When I started computer science I didn't have any experience programming, so one of the biggest goals for the object oriented programming project is to get better in using different APi's and different method while programming.

The second goal which is really important for me is to be a better team player and a proactive memeber in order to create a working project. 

The third and last one is getting better at looking up things in different sources, deciding what is the best solution and working using Git as a team on our project. I think that we will encouter several times during this project the case where we will have to choose between several things as a team.

Up until now, we didn't have a big opportunity to work in a slightly big team ( 7 memebers ). So during this project, I can try to be a teamplayer in order for us to create a working app by the end of this quarter. ALso, I don't have any experience on Git, so this is the time where I have to get used to it. 

A part from working on my personnal skills, I will get the opportuinty during this project to sharpen my programing skills in object oriented programming languages.

### Personal Plan
##### Goal
 
My personal skills are creativity and problem solving. Unfortunately until now I haven't participated in projects with teams consisting of more than 2-3 people 
and I am not sure how I am going to use my capabilities to benefit the project. The reason is that I lack communication skills.
I am also new to computer science. As a first year student I lack the experience needed for such a project.  My goal is to learn how to work in a team and of course become a better programmer.

##### Plan to achieve my goal
 
I am going to achieve my goal by studying thoroughly version control and getting used to solving problems through research.
Until this moment I have only worked on projects where I had access to strict instructions on how to handel the tasks.
So I need to do a lot of reading in order to familiarize myself with all the tools that my team and I want to use.
For me the best way to start this project is by setting rules, that will outline the means of solving problems when they appear.
I am going to actively participate in all conversations, because they are the best way to find a solution and deal with lack of coordination.
Through conversations we are going to help each other with acquiring new knowledge.
