During this meeting, we need to discuss with the TA the following issues and present our progress during the week 2.

Waqas and Silviu found some issues while building the Server/client communication and trying to make them do some simple request/response.

Nafie and Gijs tried to set up the database on the Heroku server and connecting it using JDBC, but unfortunetly using plain java to express queries is a bit hard. So we willa sk the TA about what he thinks about Spring boot.

Silviu, Stef and Axiaan searched how to build the Gui and We will discuss with the TA which one is better JavaFx or Swing.
